            // 1. * What is a Constructor ?
            //   A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created.It is used to initialize the object’s properties and ensure the object is in a valid state.

            //---

            //2. What are the Basic Concepts of OOPs?
            //   - Encapsulation: Wrapping data(fields) and behavior(methods) into a single unit (class) and restricting access using access modifiers.
            //   - Abstraction : Hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary features.
            //   - Inheritance: Allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class to promote code reuse.
            //   - Polymorphism: Allowing methods or operations to behave differently based on the object they are acting on.

            //---

            //3. What is Encapsulation?
            //   Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components to protect data integrity and enforce controlled access.

            //---

            //4. What is a Sealed Class?
            //   A sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited. It is used to prevent other classes from deriving from it and to enforce that the functionality of the class cannot be extended.

            //---

            //5. *What is the Inheritance Concept?**
            //   Inheritance is the OOP concept where one class (child/derived) inherits properties, methods, and behavior from another class (parent/base). It allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.
